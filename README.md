# Portfolio-V1
Website design influenced by https://brittanychiang.com/

(Work in Progress)
My first attempt at creating a personal portfolio website from scratch. Using HTML for structure, CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactive functions. I plan on enhancing my website as I learn more advanced and capable frameworks. Stay tuned for later versions. 

Additionally, my first attempt at seriously creating a GitHub repository. Unsure what or how this entire process works (pretty sure I'm documenting every incorrectly), but will re-edit everything to the proper standard as I learn more and more about GitHub and documentation.
